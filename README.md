## Overview and Motivation
**Problem**:
- Making solid contact with a pitch thrown in Major League Baseball is one of the hardest things to do in professional sports
- *How can a batter optimize their chance of making solid contact during an at bat?*

**Goal**:
- Arguably, one of the most important variables that makes making contact with a pitch difficult is not knowing whether the pitch will be thrown within the strike zone (be called a strike) or outside of it (be called a ball)
- Generally, a pitch thrown within the strike zone is easier to hit than one one that is thrown outside the strike zone
- *Predict whether a major league pitch will be a called strike or not in order to recommend whether a batter should swing or take the pitch with less than 2 strikes in the count*
